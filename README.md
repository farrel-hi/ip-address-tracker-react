## My process
1. Create the HTML semantic structure first
2. Create the desktop rules first and then the mobile rules second using CSS
3. Create the function for accepting IP Address only input and show it's location information plus the location in map using JavaScript with the help of [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) and [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript Function & DOM
- Flexbox
- React Hooks
- [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/)
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).
- [Publlic IP Address API](https://www.ipify.org/)

### What I learned

Here are the things that i learn:
1. Relearn and practice function in Javascript
2. Practices my CSS design
3. Learn how to use ip address and map generator API

### Continued development

I would like to continue develop my skill as a whole through projects from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
